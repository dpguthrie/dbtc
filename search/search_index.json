This library acts as a convenient interface to two different APIs that dbt Cloud offers: Cloud API: This is a REST API that exposes endpoints that allow users to programatically create, read, update, and delete resources within their dbt Cloud Account. Metadata API: This is a GraphQL API that exposes metadata generated from a job run within dbt Cloud. Requirements Python 3.7+ Requests - The elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings. sgqlc - Simple GraphQL Client Typer - Library for building CLI applications Installation pip install dbtc Basic Usage Python The interface to both APIs are located in the dbtCloudClient class. The example below shows how you use the cloud property on an instance of the dbtCloudClient class to access methods that allow for programmatic control over dbt Cloud resources. from dbtc import dbtCloudClient client = dbtCloudClient() account = client.cloud.get_account_by_name('My Account') project = client.cloud.get_project_by_name(account['id'], 'My Project') run_id = client.cloud.trigger_job_and_poll() License This project is licensed under the terms of the MIT license.","title":"Index"},{"location":"docs/#overview","text":"dbtc is an unaffiliated python interface to various dbt Cloud API endpoints.
